This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The application showcases projects, a blog, and contact information using a modern React stack.

## Features

- **React + Vite** for fast development and build performance
- **React Router** for client-side navigation between pages
- **Tailwind CSS** for utilityâ€‘first styling
- **Reusable components** for sections like the hero, skills list, projects, and contact form
- **Blog posts** stored in `src/data/posts.js`

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to view the site.

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Run the linter to check code quality:

```bash
npm run lint
```
